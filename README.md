# **Please Read**
Please contribute to this list so it does not get bad and unmaintained like the adawiki list this is based off.

# **The Basics**

- Don&#39;t ask for more than you need
- Do not resell samples (this is why TI stopped sending samples to students)
- Be prepared for a barrage of phone calls from some manufacturers.

- Have a project or something prepared in case you are questioned about the usage of the samples
