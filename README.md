Feel free to submit a PR if anything isn't covered, or you've had a different experience than what's here.

# **The Basics**

- Don&#39;t ask for more than you need
- Do not resell samples (this is why TI stopped sending samples to students)
- Be prepared for a barrage of phone calls from some manufacturers.

- You may be questioned about the use of samples. Know your project

# **Side note**
Some companies use samplecomponents to process samples. This is a google query that'll find all of them

Please report back anything useful
